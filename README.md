# Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website. This project serves as a digital curriculum vitae, showcasing my journey from childhood curiosity to my current pursuits in Software Engineering at Kirinyaga University.

## 🔗 Live Demo
**View the live site here:** [https://keiths-portfolio.vercel.app/](https://keiths-portfolio.vercel.app/)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **HTML5:** Semantic structure for accessible content.
* **CSS3:** Custom styling, responsive design, and CSS variables for theming (Dark Mode + Neon Green).
* **JavaScript:** Interactivity for the mobile navigation menu, typing text effects, and form validation.
* **FontAwesome:** Iconography for navigation and social links.

## 🚀 Web Hosting & Domain Explanation

As part of the assignment requirements, here is the breakdown of the hosting and domain strategy used for this project:

### 1. Web Hosting: Vercel
I chose **Vercel** to host this website.
* **Reasoning:** Vercel offers a seamless integration with GitHub. It automatically deploys the website whenever I push changes to the code repository (Continuous Deployment).
* **Reliability:** It utilizes a global Content Delivery Network (CDN), ensuring the site loads quickly for visitors regardless of their location.

### 2. Domain Name: `keiths-portfolio.vercel.app`
* **Identity:** For this project, I secured the unique subdomain `keiths-portfolio` under the Vercel domain. This clearly represents my personal brand ("Keith") and the purpose of the site ("Portfolio").
* **Future Expansion:** In a professional production environment, I would register a custom Top-Level Domain (TLD) such as `emmanuelkiio.tech` or `stargenius.dev` through a registrar like Namecheap or GoDaddy to further solidify the brand identity.
